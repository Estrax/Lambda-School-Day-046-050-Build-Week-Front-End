Pitch: 
Tired of loaning out your tools to a neighbor and losing them?

MVP: 
Users can log in and create a profile. They can then set up items they have available - anything from a shovels to power washers to tile saws.  Users will be able to Create, Read, Update and Delete data. A 2nd user can log in and see items that users have available and request to borrow.

Stretch: 
Add a map for loaners to set limits on how far they are willing to lend their tools out, and how far borrowers are willing to drive to borrow something.  Add a review system into the app so that the social aspect is there to ensure that neighbors are good borrowers before you approve a request.


Don't **Fork** the Repo
##### Git Instructions

- Every frontend/UI developer will be working in this repo, but on separate branches.

- After git cloning THIS repo:
   - `git checkout master` <---- Puts you on master branch.

   - You may need to `git pull` before creating a new branch. <--- Git pull fetches and downloads from the branch you are in and merges it with local repo
   
  - `git branch [firstname-lastname]` <-----  Creates the branch with your first and last name as branch name. 
     
  - `git checkout [firstname-lastname]` <---- Switches your working directory into your newly created branch.
  
  - `git push -u origin [firstname-lastname]` <-- Pushes that branch to GitHub.
      - Subsequent pushes after the above push can be done with `git push [firstname-lastname]`.
   
   - You can then `git commit` into that branch with all your changes.

   - **Once you have a fully functional feature:**
      -  `git merge master` <---- Merges your branch to the master repo.
      -  If you get any conflicts merging, contact me to help resolve them.


##### Initial Instructions

- You still need to run `yarn install` to get your node_modules.

- Netlify deployed site: [my-netlify-site].

- Reach out if you need help.
